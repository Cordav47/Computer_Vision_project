# Computer_Vision_project
The projects aim to do a quality inspection of the product and in the case of the stick also the orientation of the product with respect to the main face. We assume to be in a packaging automatic machine environment that will pack these two kind of objects. The setup.ipynb files explain the thinking behind the algorithm, while the .py files contains the functions with the tests on the photos of the products. Some imperfections are simulated to evaluate the goodness of the algorithms and its capacity to detect defects and rotations to perfrorms
